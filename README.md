# Graphene Oxide Nanoparticle

This repository is a bank of Graphene Oxide (GO) nanoparticles generated using [make-graphitics](https://github.com/velocirobbie/make-graphitics). GO particles are square with lateral size L from 1.2 to 2.8 nm. Carbon atoms are functionalised hydroxyl groups only.

Folders are in the format Lx_OCy_OHz, where L refers to the lateral size of the GO particle, OC refers to the oxygen over carbon atom ratio at the basal plane of the GO particle, and OH to the hydrogen over oxygen ratio at the edge of the particle.
