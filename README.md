# Graphene Oxide Nanoparticle

This repository is a bank of Graphene Oxide (GO) nanoparticles generated using [make-graphitics](https://github.com/velocirobbie/make-graphitics). GO particles are square with lateral size L from 1.2 to 2.8 nm. Only hydroxyl groups are attached to the particles.

Folders are in the format Lx_OCy_OHz, where L refers to the lateral size of the GO particle, OC

h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x
